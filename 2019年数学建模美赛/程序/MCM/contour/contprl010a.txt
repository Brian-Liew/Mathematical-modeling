    Description:
      Abstract:
        This map layer shows elevation contour lines for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.  The map 
        layer was derived from the 100-meter resolution elevation data set which is published by the 
        National Atlas of the United States, and is in the same Albers Equal-area Conic projection as that 
        source data set.  Contour intervals match the steps used in the National Atlas Color-Sliced 
        Elevation data sets.  Contours were adjusted so that they are in the proper relationship to 
        National Atlas 1:1,000,000-scale lakes, reservoirs, and wide (double-line) streams.
      Purpose:
        These data are intended for geographic display and analysis at the national level, and for large 
        regional areas.  The data should be displayed and analyzed at scales appropriate 
        for 1:1,000,000-scale data.  No responsibility is assumed by the National Atlas of the United 
        States in the use of these data.

      Process_Step:
        Process_Description:	
          Contours were derived from the National Atlas PR raster elevation data by a custom process, 
          created as a multi-step script in the ArcGIS environment by Dean Tyler, U.S. Geological Survey. 

          Contour intervals are the same as the step intervals in National Atlas PR color-sliced elevation.  
          All values are in meters; the following contours are included: 50, 100, 150, 200, 300, 400, 500, 
          600, 700, 800, 900, 1000, 1100, 1200.

          The zero-elevation contour was omitted and replaced with the 1:1,000,000-scale coastline.
 
          The raster data were converted to areas, then to contour lines.  Areas too small to resolve 
          at 1:1,000,000-scale were deleted.  Contour lines were smoothed and processing artifacts were 
          cleaned up.

          Contours were adjusted so that they were in the proper relationship to 1:1,000,000-scale lakes, 
          reservoirs, and wide (double-line) streams.  (A double-line stream is one that is wide enough 
          at 1:1,000,000 scale to be portrayed as a polygon instead of as a line.)  Contours go around 
          lakes rather than intersecting with them.  Contours cross double-line streams at right angles.  
          Contours may cross glaciers, swamps or marshes.

          Contours were not adjusted to align with single-line streams.  There are small mismatches between 
          the drainage channels as defined by the 100-meter resolution raster elevation data and 
          the 1:1,000,000-scale streams linework.  As a result, re-entrants (the point where a contour 
          crosses a stream) are approximately rather than precisely located.
